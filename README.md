# Rock - Paper - Scissors
## [my-second-project](https://empzsolt.github.io/my-second-project-/)
The simple "Rock, Paper, Scissors" is an interesting game. As we used to settle disputes in the past, now it offers an easily accessible online entertainment. In its current version, the fight is against a randomly choosing computer, which ensures a fair game.

The game users can relive their childhood and test their patience and luck during a easy game. It can help promote problem-solving thinking. Finally, it can cause happy moments for people of all ages.

## Design
### Typography
Google Fonts was used for the following font:
- Press Start 2P is a bitmap font based on the font design from 1980s Namco arcade games. It works best at sizes of 8px, 16px and other multiples of 8. Although the design of uppercase letters and digits dates back to Atari's "Sprint" (1977), the specific glyph forms in this TrueType conversion are based on those from "Return of Ishtar" (1986), one of the first games to include and regularly use lowercase as well as uppercase letters in its screen font. 
### Imagery
- I found the introductory rock-paper-scissors image on a public website. I cut the various items from the introductory picture. I have credited this in the credits section.
### Features
- Header
     * It is located at the top of the web page and contains the name of the game supplemented with font awesome icons. The icons represent the given items, their colors are the same as the colors seen in the introductory image, thereby strengthening the connection between them, and they are also animated to indicate the nature of the elements. The choice of font is also emphasized here, which is reminds of an arcade game.
     * This section is intended to inform the user about the topic of the page.
     ![A screenshot of the header](./assets/images/header.webp)
- The game options
     * The game options use interactive buttons to choose between three items: Rock, Paper, Scissors. Furthermore, the colors of the buttons harmonize with the colors of the items shown in the introductory image.
     * This area clearly present the choices if the user wants to play.
     ![A srceenshot of the game options](./assets/images/options.webp)
- The game results
     * As soon as the user has selected a button, the symbol that belonged to the button will appear on the player's display, on the left side of the screen.
     * A random symbol generated by JavaScript code appears on the computer display, on the right side of the screen. At the same time, the code decides who the winner is based on the entered rules.
     * A small message pops up between the chosen symbols and the game option buttons, telling the player who the winner is. Furthermore, the scores are updated on the player's or computer's display.
     * The result is obvious and the explanation of the points is clear and clearly visible to the player, making the game completely transparent.

- The Footer
     * The footer presents the rules of the game.
     * Knowing the rules is indispensable for the player to understand and enjoy the game.
     ![A sreenshot of the footer](./assets/images/footer.webp)
- Features Left to Implement
     * Possibility of further development:
          - by adding additional items, for example: Lizard, Spok, or inventing completely new characters
          - by adding user vs user mode, connect two users to play online
     
### Accessibility
During the coding, I made sure that the website was as user-friendly as possible. I achieved this by:
- Using Semantic HTML.
- Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
- Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text.
- Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
## Technologies Used

## Testing
Testing took place continuously during the entire construction. I used Chrome's developer tools during the build to try out new ideas and prevent or, if necessary, fix problems.
During the development, I used Google's developer tools to ensure everything worked as expected, to successfully discover bugs, determine their origin, and fix them.
- I tested playing this game in different browsers: Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Firefox.
- I confirmed that this game results are always correct.
- I confirmed that this project is responsive, functions on all standard screen sizes using the devtools device toolbar.
- I confirmed that the header, game options, game results and the footer are all readable and easy to understand.
### Bugs
- The first time I changed the font, the text hung over one of the buttons in the game options. This is how I increased the original size settings of the buttons.
- At first, I did not notice that the name of the score collector on both displays was "Your scores". Only after a few tests did the mistyping become apparent.
- When I decided to put a versus text between the two displays, I couldn't manage to keep it centered and responsive. Then I created a wrapper div for the game zone and set display to flex , flex-direction to row and justify-content to center . 
- The JavaScript code did not want to work before the first run. When I reviewed the code, I found a typo in the constants.
- With the appearance of the scissors symbol, the display size always became a little smaller. I solved the problem by resizing the image.
### W3C Validator
The W3C validator was used to validate the HTML. It was also used to validate CSS in the style.css file.
- No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C HTML Validator](./assets/images/html-validator.webp)
- No errors were found when passing through the official [CSS Validator](./assets/images/css-validator.webp)
### JSHint JavaScript Validator
The JSHint JavaScript Validator was used to validate the JavaScript code.
- No errors were returned when passing through the official [JSHint JavaScript Validator](./assets/images/js-validator.webp), but 15 warnings appeared, the vast majority of which indicate that I am using a keyword introduced in the ECMAScript 6 (ES6) version, and on one occasion that I am using a function inside a loop, which can be confusing. Despite all this, the game works perfectly.
### Lighthouse
I used Lighthouse within the Chrome Developer Tools to allow me to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website.
#### Index page
Final lighthouse testing:
- [Desktop size](./assets/images/lighthouse-desktop-final.webp)
      Suggestions:
      1. Polyfills and transforms enable legacy browsers to use new JavaScript features. However, many aren't necessary for modern browsers. For your bundled JavaScript, adopt a modern script deployment strategy using module/nomodule feature detection to reduce the amount of code shipped to modern browsers, while retaining support for legacy browsers. - Despite the problem, the game works perfectly.
      2. Set an explicit width and height on image elements to reduce layout shifts and improve CLS. - I didn't use specific numbers to scale the images to keep them responsive.
