# Rock - Paper - Scissors
## [my-second-project](https://empzsolt.github.io/my-second-project-/)
The simple "Rock, Paper, Scissors" is an interesting game. As we used to settle disputes in the past, now it offers an easily accessible online entertainment. In its current version, the fight is against a randomly choosing computer, which ensures a fair game.

The game users can relive their childhood and test their patience and luck during a easy game. It can help promote problem-solving thinking. Finally, it can cause happy moments for people of all ages.

## Design

### Color Scheme
![Image of the website's backgroundcolors](./assets/images/background-img.webp)
The website uses a palette of warm pastel colors that perfectly match the wedding atmosphere. The color palette was created with the help of the Coolors website.
### Typography
Google Fonts was used for the following fonts:
- Dancing Script is a lively casual script where the letters bounce and change size slightly. It is used for the cover text of the hero image and all the headings on the pages.
- Crimson Text is a font family for book production in the tradition of beautiful oldstyle typefaces. It is used for the basic body texts on the pages. 
- Caveat is a handwriting type family. It is used for the countdown clock title.
### Imagery
The hero image and the images of the contact people are self-made images. The hotel's logo, three images of the hotel and three locations of the honeymoon were taken from public websites. I have credited these in the credits section.
### Features
- Logo and Navigation Bar
     * Featured on all 5 pages, the full responsive navigation bar includes links to the Logo with an animated icon, Home page, Schedule page, Location page, Honeymoon page and Rsvp application page and is identical in each page to allow for easy navigation.
     * This section will allow the user to easly navigate from page to page across all devices without having to revert back to the pervious page via the 'back' button.
     * For transparent and easy selection, the navigation links are underlined and highlighted with color.
     ![A screenshot of the navigation bar](./assets/images/nav-bar.webp)
- The Hero image
     * The hero image contains a photo with a text overlay and a countdown clock that highlights Marisa and Zsolt's love.
     * This part attracts the user's attention with a zoom in animation and puts the couple in the center.
     * The countdown clock specifically draws attention to the proximity of the event.
     ![A srceenshot of the hero image, the text content and the countdown clock](./assets/images/hero-img.webp)
- The Footer
     * In the footer section located the contacts, so the members of the wedding party.
     * Introducing the members with a separate photo and their contact information.
     ![A sreenshot of the footer](./assets/images/footer.webp)
- Schedule page
     * The schedule section is designed to inform the user about the detailed wedding program.
     * It also informs the dress code.
     ![A sreenshot of the schedule page](./assets/images/scedule.webp)
- Location page
     * The location section presents the hotel where the wedding will take place.
     * In addition to the location logo, three on-site photos, and Google Maps location, there is also a link embedded in the name of the hotel, which leads to their official website, informing the visitor.
     ![A sreenshot of the location page](./assets/images/location.webp)
- Honeymoon page
     * The honeymoon page simply and concisely describes the locations, complete with pictures and duration.
     * It also contains a text message which purpose is to thank the guests for their presence and hint at the possibility of contributing.
     ![A sreenshot of the honeymoon page](./assets/images/honeymoon.webp)
- RSVP Form
     * This page allows the user to register for the wedding. The user must enter his/her name, which day he/she wishes to participate, and what menu he/she would like to eat.
     * Different icons help to separate the different question sections for easier overview.
     * He/she can only apply after he/she have entered all the required information. The submit button is represented by a love letter image.
     ![A sreenshot of the rsvp](./assets/images/rsvp.webp)
- Thank You page
     * This page pops up after successful registration. It contains a thank you note and says that the home page will automatically return. 
     ![A screenshot of the thank-you page](./assets/images/thank-you.webp)
- Features Left to Implement
     * A page about the story of Marisa and Zsolt, how they met, how they fell in love. This can be combined with a photo gallery or a video.
     * A financial contribution option could be added to the honeymoon page so the guests can support the couple for their honeymoon.
### Accessibility
During the coding, I made sure that the website was as user-friendly as possible. I achieved this by:
- Using Semantic HTML.
- Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
- Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text.
- Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
- Ensuring menus are accessible by marking the current page as current for screen readers.
## Technologies Used
### Languages Used
HTML and CSS were used to create this website. There is also JavaScript in the code, but it is from an external source.

## Testing
Testing took place continuously during the entire construction. I used Chrome's developer tools during the build to try out new ideas and prevent or, if necessary, fix problems.
During the development, I used Google's developer tools to ensure everything worked as expected, to successfully discover bugs, determine their origin, and fix them.
- I tested that this page works in different browsers: Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, Firefox.
- I confirmed that this project is responsive, functions on all standard screen sizes using the devtools device toolbar.
- I confirmed that the navigation, header, cover text, contacts, schedule, location, honeymoon and the rsvp are all readable and easy to understand.
- I have confirmed that the form works: requires entires in every field and the submit button works leading to the thank-you page.
The following issues were raised during my mid project meeting with my mentor:
- He drew my attention to the fact that the header needs to be widened, for the sake of a more balanced appearance. That's why I increased the height from 3 rem to 4 rem.
- He advised me to fix the validator error caused by the countdown clock by moving the style declarations to the style.ccs file. Also, if I can, I should replace it with another clock, since the demo logo in the corner of the it doesn't look good. In the end I did that.
- He indicated that the footer was too close to the bottom of the page and it would look better if I move it up, as I had already done with the top part. I solved this with a simple style declaration: padding: 10px 0;.
- On the location page, he suggested that I look for a short informational text about the hotel, thereby telling the guests more about the accommodation. I copied the relevant lines from the hotel's information page.
- On the rsvp form, he noticed that the allergy input field can be set by visitors and this can easily cause confusion, so he asked me to set it to fixed. In the relevant css attribute selector, I set resize: none; sytle declaration.
- For the rsvp form, he suggested that I attach a textual confirmation to the submit image about what the button means, for the sake of clarity. That's why I added a label element to the submit image with the text submit.
- He advised that by submitting the rsvp form, a thank you page should appear, which would automatically return to the main page after a certain period of time. That's why I created a new page, thank-you.html, which thanks the visitor for applying and informs that the site will soon return to its home page. All I had to do was set the following values ​​in the meta data:
'meta http-equiv="refresh" content="10; url=index.html"'
- He suggested that the names of all my uploaded images should be in lowercase letters. So I re-uploaded a few pictures with small initials.
### Bugs
- When I first time used the font awesome icons and they didn't show up. I later realized that these were not free icons, so I replaced as many as I could find to be reasonably similar. This happend with the main logo in the header. The rest I replaced with similar images. This was the solution is the rsvp page, where the images reprezenting the different section of the qestions.
- When I used the iframe element for showing the hotel location it showed a broken sign and said the google rejecting the connection. It turned out that I copied the google search url as the source and not the correct google map source.
- The first time I tried responsive design, it became apparent that the footer contact people could not stay together at a smaller aspect ratio and broke the balance, and the images didn't keep their proportions either. First of all, at a smaller aspect ratio, I introduced two lines, those avoiding fragmentation and overcrowding, and used 'object-fit: cover;' style declaration to keep the aspect ratio on the pictures. 
- On the honeymoon page, the pictures of the locations also caused problems at smaller screen sizes. After a while, they ran into each other or the ratios simply weren't good. So I decided to switch from the horizontal to the vertical positioning at a smaller screen size. I achieved this by changing the value of display to block.
- There were also problems with keeping the images in position on the display of smaller devices on the rsvp page. I was able to compensate for this by adding additional sytle declarations, such as height and margin changes.
- I had to find a countdown clock and download it to get more effect of the main page. But the first one I found and applied was unfortunately only a demo version and the html validator also threw an error on it. The reason for the error was that the size details and setting of the frame was in the iframe code. So I replaced these styles with an id attribute and transferred the style declarations to the style.css page. This solved the error problem, but since there was still a demo label in the corner of the clock, I decided to replace it with another one. I found a suitable one on the TickCounter site.
### W3C Validator
The W3C validator was used to validate the HTML. It was also used to validate CSS in the style.css file.
- No errors were returned when passing through the official [W3C HTML Validator](./assets/images/w3c-html-validator.webp)
- No errors were found when passing through the official [CSS Validator](./assets/images/css-validator.webp)
### Lighthouse
I used Lighthouse within the Chrome Developer Tools to allow me to test the performance, accessibility, best practices and SEO of the website.
#### Home page / Index page
Final lighthouse testing:
- [Desktop size](./assets/images/lighthouse-homepage-destop-final.webp)
      Suggestions:
      1. A long cache lifetime can speed up repeat visits to your page. - So considering the circumstances, I converted the images to the smallest possible size and webp format.
      2. Screen reader users rely on frame titles to describe the contents of frames. - In this case, with a downloaded javaScript-based countdown clock, I couldn't set a title for the iframe. However, I considered the effectiveness to be much more important, so I kept it.
- [Mobile size](./assets/images/lighthouse-homepage-mobil-final.webp)
      Suggestions:
      1. Consider adding `preconnect` or `dns-prefetch` resource hints to establish early connections to important third-party origins. - These elements are required for proper design.
      2. A long cache lifetime can speed up repeat visits to your page. - So considering the circumstances, I converted the images to the smallest possible size and webp format.
